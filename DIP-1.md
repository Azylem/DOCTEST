## What is a DIP ? <a name="WhatisaDIP"></a>
DIP stands for Dero Improvement Proposal. A DIP is a design document providing information to the Dero community, describing a new feature or its processes or environment. The DIP provides a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The DIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.

## DIP Rationale <a name="DIPRationale"></a>
We intend DIPs to be the primary instrument for proposing new features, for collecting community technical input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have in result gone into Dero. DIPs are maintained as documents with a revision control. For DERO implementers, DIPs are a convenient way to track the progress of their implementation. Ideally each implementation maintainer would list the DIPs that they have implemented. This will give end users a convenient way to know the current status of a given implementation or library.
