## What is a DIP ?
DIP stands for Dero Improvement Proposal. A DIP is a design document providing information to the Dero community, describing a new feature or its processes or environment. The DIP provides a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature. The DIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.
